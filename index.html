<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I am Ryan Corrigan and I am a computer science major who enjoys playing sports and video games. I also enjoy other small hobbies that relate to physical activity and anything involving computers. I have a mom and dad and 2 older brothers who are both out of college. I chose to major in computer science because I have always loved computers and thought that I could do it for a living.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p>My favorite hobby would probably be playing table tennis with my friends. My best friend and I have been playing table tennis or commonly known as ping pong for probably half of our lives. Everytime I would go over to his house we would play and have a blast. Now that we are both in college we still find time to play ping pong with each other and the other people that we have met along the way.</p>
